# sql-challenge
 A repository to hold my Module9 Challenge files.

We start with creating the ERD, linking tables which have related data (employees have departments, titles, salaries, and managers, but each employee only has one salary, reports to one manager, has one title, and only belongs to one department, for example).

Next, we move to creating the tables in schemata.sql. Tables 'departments', 'dept_emp', 'dept_manager', 'salaries', 'titles', and 'employees' are created, each with their relevant column names, which in turn have their relevant data types. Data from the appropriate .csv files are imported into the relevant table in Postgres.

Finally, we come to queries.sql, where the questions from the assignment ReadMe file are interpreted into queries and answered.
